Social Media Intelligence

The goal of this project is to identify and link online profiles to a single individual and to attempt to create a mental profile based on 
their posts, likes and dislikes. This mental profile will also have a risk percentage which will give a score to identify if that person
is a risk to themselves or others.  More than likely most people will be identified as a risk, which is why I plan on implementing risk
thresholds. Hypothetically a high risk individual could potentially have targeted posts that will try to put that person in a lower risk
bracket, lets say Person A is a high risk individual and may be sympathizing with extremists, by targeting them with posts about how 
inhumane these extremists may be, person A might then change their opinions to the extremists and will stop sypathizing. This is also
risky, it should be noted this may have an opposite effect, Person A might decide that it's the "Main stream media" painting them in a 
bad light. Situations like this could be circumvented by showing anti-extremist posts to Person B, Person B may be trusted by Person A and 
may post about the inhumanity of said extremists, posts by person B will then be shown to Person A and it could prevent sympthization. 
The mental profile also stated below could be used to identify mental disorders (schizophrenia, depression, sociopathy, etc.) and help
that individual seek help. Using the FBIs warning signs for serial killers although unlikely it could be possible to find a serial murderer or to find those at risk for becoming one.

Goals:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Link social media accounts to a user

-Use public social media posts to find their most common areas, maybe a heat map

-Use public social media information to find any instance of them on a site like pastebin (find if they've had any further information 
included in leaks)

-Maybe have some sort of searchable database of previously searched information

-Use social media to create a mental profile, find their likes, dislikes, find how they would react to certain things(ways to push buttons)

-Use mental profile to ID mental disorders

-Create a web interface to easily sort through found data and to easily search targets


I am not responsible for how people use this, I'm making a tool to show how we've given up privacy.
